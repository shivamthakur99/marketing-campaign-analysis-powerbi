# Marketing Campaign Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on an end-to-end **marketing campaign analysis** using customer demographic, behavioral, and transactional data. The objective is to uncover actionable insights that help businesses improve campaign effectiveness, customer segmentation, and revenue growth. The analysis emphasizes how income, education, family size, and purchasing behavior influence spending patterns and campaign acceptance.

This repository is designed for **business analytics portfolios, academic projects, and interview demonstrations**, showcasing data-driven thinking and business-oriented storytelling.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-level marketing data, including:

### Demographic Features

* Income
* Education Level
* Marital Status
* Number of Children

### Behavioral & Transactional Features

* Total Amount Spent
* Product-wise Spending (Wine, Meat, etc.)
* Purchase Channels (Web, Catalog, Store)
* Website Visits
* Campaign Acceptance

### Time-Based Features

* Quarterly income trends
* Quarterly spending patterns

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

### 1. Demographic Insights

* A majority of customers are **married and highly educated**, though statistical testing shows no significant correlation between marital status and education.
* **Education level positively correlates with income**, indicating higher earning potential among more educated customers.
* **Household size (number of children)** shows a negative relationship with income and discretionary spending.

### 2. Income as a Key Business Driver

* Income acts as a strong proxy for multiple customer behaviors.
* Higher income is positively associated with:

  * Total spending
  * Wine and meat consumption
  * Campaign acceptance
* Income is negatively correlated with website visits, suggesting that high-income customers are more decisive buyers rather than frequent browsers.

### 3. Product-Level Insights

* Wine spending is strongly linked to:

  * Higher income
  * Meat consumption
  * Purchases through catalog and physical stores
* Wine and meat emerge as complementary premium product categories.

### 4. Campaign Performance

* Customers with higher income demonstrate a greater likelihood of accepting marketing campaigns.
* Income-based targeting proves more effective than marital-status-based segmentation.

### 5. Time-Series Trends

* From Q3–Q4 2012 to Q1 2013, income and spending increased simultaneously, indicating strong demand.
* By 2014, spending dropped to its lowest point despite continued income growth, highlighting a disconnect between purchasing power and consumer behavior.

---

## 💡 Business Implications

* Income is a more reliable predictor of customer value than marital status.
* High-income, highly educated customers represent a premium segment with strong revenue potential.
* Customers with children have constrained discretionary spending, especially for non-essential products.
* Declining spending despite rising income signals potential disengagement or ineffective campaign strategies.

---

## 🚀 Recommendations

* Prioritize high-income customers for premium and personalized campaigns, especially for wine and meat products.
* Leverage catalog and in-store channels for high-value segments, emphasizing curated and exclusive experiences.
* Design value-based or bundle offers to engage families with children.
* Combine income with behavioral metrics (purchase frequency, channel preference, campaign response) for better segmentation.
* Re-evaluate campaign messaging and timing to convert income growth into actual spending.
